            <p>
                In our urban and suburban houses what should we do without cats?
                In our sitting or bedrooms, our libraries, in our kitchens and
                storerooms, our farms, barns, and rickyards, in our docks, our
                granaries, our ships, and our wharves, in our corn markets, meat
                markets, and other places too numerous to mention, how useful they
                are! In our ships, however, the rats oft set them at defiance;
                still they are of great service.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                How wonderfully patient is the cat when watching for rats or mice,
                their home! How well Shakespeare in Pericles, Act iii., describes
                this keen attention of the cat to its natural pursuit!  
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="quote">
                The cat, with eyne of burning coal, Now crouches from (before) the
                mouse's hole.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                A slight rustle, and the fugitive comes forth; a quick, sharp,
                resolute motion, and the cat has proved its usefulness. Let any
                one have a plague of rats and mice, as I once had, and let them be
                delivered therefrom by cats, as I was, and they will have a
                lasting and kind regard for them.
